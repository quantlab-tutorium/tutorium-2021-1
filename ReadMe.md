# QuantLab tools and technology tutorium.

This project contains exercises to be worked on during the quantlab tutorium. Very often you will find a test in **src/test/java**, which you can use to check your solutions. Of course you can also create your own main method to run your code, while working on the problem. The following week you will often find a (possible) solution in **src/solution/java**. If you have problems or questions always feel free to ask!



## 04/16 Introduction to our tools

We will use today to get used to the eclipse IDE and check out the other tools we will be using for the lecture Numerical Methods for Financial Mathematics.

### Hello World

Like any respectable coding tutorial your first first exercise is to write your own "Hello world" program, i.e. create a class with a main method that prints "Hello world" to the command line. You can create the class either in project or create your own java project in your workspace.

### Bonus

Write a program that will ask you for your name and then greet you. Alternatively you can also give your name to the program as a launch argument.

**Hint:** Maybe the easiest way to get input data to a running program is via a *Scanner* on *System.in*. That way you can interact directly on the command line.
